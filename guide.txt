I want to make a landing screen for super robot wars and robots in general (so add ac) that leads to two separate pages for starter robots for super side and real side. The landing screen should make heavy use of animations and i would like to implement effects and stat screens for the robots but I'm not starting until I have javascript as the other two openclassrooms projects act as showcases of the fact that I can use html, css and sass.
